Scan wifi to check if your Raspberry detects available wifi


```shell
iwlist scan | grep <SSID>
```


If you see your wifi SSID in the out of the command above. Your wifi dongle is fine, and RPi is seeing your wifi.


Open `raspi-config`


```shell
sudo raspi-config
```

- Select `System Options/Wireless LAN`
- Select country
- Input `SSID` and `password`
- Select `OK` and `Finish`
- If RPi asks you to reboot, DON’T.

There is case which `raspi-config` tell you that it


```shell
Could not communicate with wpa_supplicant
```


This happens quite often with RPi 2b (my model). One workaround is run:


```shell
sudo wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -D wext -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
dhclient wlan0
```


and then repeat the `raspi-config` procedure above.


## Auto connect to wifi after rebooting


To automatically connect to your AP after restart edit the `wlan0` interface on your `/etc/network/interfaces` as follow:


```shell
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```


```shell
sudo reboot
```

May wifi be with you!
